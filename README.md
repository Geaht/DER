This software was tested with MATLAB (R2018a) on Linux, Windows and MacOS X

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The DER algorithm was written in MATLAB2018a. 
To run the code the following MATLAB packages are required:  

* *Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox*
* *Wavelet Toolbox*  


## How to use the code 

Download the source code from this repository and add it to your MATLAB path. 
To run the automated artefact detection you need to execute `DER.m` in MATLAB.  
Please provide the data path and define the spike-sorting algorithm used (*'Wave_clus'* or *'Combinato'*) as:  

```
DER(data_path,'Wave_clus')
```  

## Structure of the code

The detection pipeline is structured in three parts: 

* Part I - Detection of artifacts within diffrerent wire bundles  
The detection of artifacts across different bundles is done by `der_detectArtifacts.m`.  

* Part II - Detection of spikes within channels of same wire bundle  
The detection of artifacts within bundles is done by `der_detectDuplicateSpikes.m`.  

* Part III - Detection of suspicious cross-correlations  
Calculation of all cross-correlations is performed by `der_cal_spike_cross_corr_mat.m`.
Spike events in suspicious central bins of the corss-correlograms are identified by `der_detect_cross_corr_spikes.m`.

### Data structures

Within this pipeline the data structure needed for detection is created by `der_get_spikeInfos.m`.
This script generates a MATLAB table containing all required information on the recorded spike events.
These information include the timestamp and the waveform of the spike event (64 data points). 
Additionally, information on the recroded clusters (clusrter ID, unit class, channel number, detection threshold, wire bundle ID, anatomical region) as well as a detection label is stored. 

The DER alogorithm is currently compatible with the output structures of *Combinato Spike Sorting* and *Wave_clus*.
In order to apply the algorithm to other spike sorting algorithms you can easily adjust `der_get_spikeInfos.m` 
and `der_save_spikeinfos.m` to your data structure. 

Detected spike events are labeled individually for each part of the detection pipeline using prime factor labels.
The detection label is given by the procuct of the following prime factors:

Factor | Part detected
:---|:---
2   | across bundles (Part I)
3   | within the same channel (Part II)  
5   | within the same bundle (but different channel) (Part II)  
7   | based on the cross-correlograms (Part III)
